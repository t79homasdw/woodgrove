## Building blocks

This section provide details for the Woodgrove Groceries live demo app. This app is based on dotnet 8 web app with Razor pages. For the UI, the project uses Bootstrap 5.x, and JQuery.

Every use case (demo) must have a unique **ID**, such as **MFA** (multifactor authentication), **CA** (conditional access), or **SSPR** (self-service password reset). The use case ID is used in the following files.

### Use cases

1. [/Pages/Shared/AboutThisDemoPartial.cshtml](./Pages/Shared/AboutThisDemoPartial.cshtml) contains the content of the Bootstrap off canvas. The off canvas is shown when a visitor clicks on the **Select a use case** button (right side of the screen). 
1. To add a new use case (demo):
    1. Find the DIV element with `class="dropdown"` and add your demo under one of the categories. The link to your demo must be in the following format `href="#usecase=ID"`, where the ID represents your use case ID. For example, `href="#usecase=SSPR"`.
    1. Locate the `<div id="useCases">` element and add a child element `<div id="useCase_ID" class="useCase">` , where the ID represents your use case ID. For example, `<div id="useCase_SSPR" class="useCase">`.
    1. In the use case DIV element, add an `<h4>` header, a short description, and a link to start the demo `href="/SignIn?handler=ID"` where the ID represents the use case ID. For example, `href="/SignIn?handler=SSPR"`.
    1. If your demo has a help page, add another link to your help page. For example, `<a role="button" href="/help/SSPR">Learn how Microsoft configured the Woodgrove tenant</a>`.
    1. Finally, scroll down to the JavaScript section and add your use case ID to the `var useCases = ["Default", "AssignmentRequired",..]` collection.

1. The  [/Pages/SignIn.cshtml.cs](./Pages/SignIn.cshtml.cs) contains the actions to start the use casesS. 
1. To add a new use case, add new function with the use case ID. For example, for **SSPR** the function name will be OnGet**SSPR**. Then a call to the TrackAndAuth method. Provide the use case ID, the post redirect URL, and whether  to ignore the single-sign-on. For most of the use cases this parameter will be **true**. Otherwise the visitor might skip the sign-in experience and won't be able to experience your demo.

    ```
    public IActionResult OnGetSSPR()
    {
        return this.TrackAndAuth("SSPR", "/", true);
    }
    ``` 

### Help files

To provide help page for your use case (recommented), do the following:

1. Create a new Razor web page under the [/Areas/Help/Pages](./Areas/Help/Pages/) folder. The following command will create such a file for you. Replace the **ID** with your use case ID.

    ```
    dotnet new page --name ID --namespace woodgrovedemo.Help.Pages --output  Areas/Help/Pages
    ```

1. In the .cshtml.cs file, add the telemetry with your use case unique ID. You can copy it from another use case, such as [SSPR.cshtml.cs](./Areas/Help/Pages/SSPR.cshtml.cs).
1. Then in the **cshtml** file adds the content guide. You can copy the content from another help file. **Important**, make sure to enter the exact number of steps in the `@await Html.PartialAsync("_Steps.cshtml", 5)` code. In this example, there are five steps.
1. Create a sub folder with your use case ID under the [/wwwroot/Help/](./wwwroot/Help/) folder.
1. Add the screenshots into the folder you created.

## Create a pull request

When creating a pull request always set the target branch as **vNext**. Changes to this branch will be automatically deployed to the <https://private.woodgrovedemo.com>. So you can test it in the staging environment. After you confirm everything works as expected. Create another PR to merge the changes into the **main** branch.

## Deployment

After you completed writing your code, and tested it locally in your development workstation, it's time to publish your changes. 

- This GitHub repository uses a GitHub action called [main_woodgrove-groceries.yml](./.github/workflows/main_woodgrove-groceries.yml) which is triggered on **commit** to the **main** branch, or on pull request **merge**. 
- You can check the status of your dempoloyen in the last commit. Usually it takes 2-3 minutes. 
- The [/appsettings.json](./appsettings.json) contains empty or fake values. To change the settings (if you have access) go to Woodgrove Azure Service App and select the **App Settings** from the menu. Then add or change the app settings. **NEVER** add any information from the Woodgrove tenant that my cause security or privacy issues.

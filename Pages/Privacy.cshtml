    <h3 style="padding-top: 25px;">Personal data we collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style="padding-top: 15px;"><b>Information that you give us directly</b>: during the sign-up flow (when you
            create an account) or update your account, you provide some of this data directly that is stored under your
            account.
            The information you enter during the sign-up:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Display name </b> - to create an account, use the first letter of your first name and last name.
                </li>
                <li><b>Email address</b> - the sign-in email address which must be verified and stored in your account.
                </li>
                <li><b>Social account</b> - when you sign-in with a social account like Facebook and Google, your social
                    account unique identifier is stored in the directory.</li>
                <li><b>Country</b> - the demo allows you to select one of three countries. No need to select your 'real' country or city.</li>
                <li><b>City</b> - from a list of 9 cities.</li>
                <li><b>Special diet </b> - for the demo you are asked to enter eggs. It's an optional field and no need to provide any personal preferences.</li>
                <li><b>Boolean indicator</b> - Accept our terms of use and privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="padding-top: 15px;"><b>Information we collect automatically when you sign-in</b>: for all flows, such
            as sign-in, multi-factor authentication, sign-up, password reset, profile editing and more, we get some of
            it by collecting data about your interactions, and use. Audit log events are only retained for 30 days. For
            more information, check out the <a

            <b>Information we collect automatically when you use the @Configuration["Web:DemoName"] Demo app</b>:
            App Service collects the same kinds of monitoring data. Check out the <a

    <h3 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Creating an account</h3>
    The purpose of this sample application is for illustration only. You are not obligated to provide your personal
    information, such as first name, last name, location etc. Make sure <u>not</u> to use any of your real details that
    can reveal your identity.

    In some flows, such as sign-up, sign-in, or multi-factor authentication, you are prompted for an email address or
    phone number, which must be verified and stored in your account.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Social account</h3>

    Social or enterprise login uses information from social or enterprise identity providers, such as Microsoft,
    Facebook and Google accounts to facilitate logins to the @Configuration["Web:DemoName"] live demo application. This simplifies
    registrations and sign-in for you. Social or enterprise identities are managed by a federated identity provider.
    Microsoft Entra External ID stores additional information about your account, such as display name, first name, and
    last name. Microsoft Entra External ID also stores the social or enterprise unique identifier that is linked to your
    social or enterprise account.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Accounts clean up</h3>

    As users try this demo application, it’s possible that an excess number of accounts will be created in the Microsoft Entra External ID
    tenant over time. When users no longer access the demo application (using last interactive and non-interactive
    sign-in date and time), these inactive accounts may be deleted automatically from the directory. If your account has been
    deleted, you will have to sign-up again.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px;">Delete your account</h3>

    You can delete your account at anytime using <a asp-area="" asp-page="/DeleteMyAccount">this link</a>. Your
     account will be permanently deleted (it will be removed from the recycle bin immediately) along with any personal information you have provided.
    Sign-in logs will remain in our system for <a
                href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-reports-data-retention#how-long-does-azure-ad-store-the-data">seven days</a>.
